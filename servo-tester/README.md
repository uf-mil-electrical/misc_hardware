# Servo Tester

In this directory, it will store the firmware and PCB information for an inlab servo tester.

We frequently work on servos, so it would be very convient to have a device that can test.

## Directories

* [Firmware](./Firmware/) (Stores codes, build files, test drivers, etc.)
* [PCB](./PCB/) (Stores PCB files, will probably be in KiCAD because I am graduating, and Dr. Schwartz will never know the difference 😉. ❤️ Geniuely though, thank you for everything!)
